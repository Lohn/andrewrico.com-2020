### ANONYMOUS INFORMATION
Anonymous Information is information that does not identify you. It can include data you give us, like your zip code, age or gender (when not combined with more detailed information). We also collect data such as your IP address, how you found us, what products you search for,and how much time you spend with us. We aggregate this information to understand our customers and to improve our site.
Like many companies, we use cookies and other technology to collect Anonymous Information. A cookie is a data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive. A cookie makes it more convenient for you to use our site—for example you may not have to reenter information every time you visit. You can disable cookies, just follow the instructions on your web browser. However, without cookies, you may not be able to use some of our customized features.
We also use third-party technology, such as Google Analytics, to collect Anonymous Information. In addition to providing us web data, this technology enables us to deliver targeted advertising. We do not control these technologies, nor do we have a say in their privacy policies. You can learn more by visiting www.aboutads.info/consumers and you might be able to opt-out of some of this advertising; visit www.aboutads.info/choices. Opting-out will not block all ads; you may still receive generic ads.
Some browsers have a “Do Not Track” preference that signals you do not want your web activity tracked. These features don’t have an industry standard yet, so we currently do not recognize them.

### INFORMATION WE SHARE
We will only share your Personally Identifiable Information:

IF you authorize us to. For example, if you fill out an application and request that it be submitted to a carrier or a carrier’s administrator for membership processing.

IF we collaborate with or hire a company to perform services on our behalf. For example, we may hire a company to manage customer email marketing. We will not permit these companies to share your Personally Identifiable Information or market other services to you without your consent.

IF we believe, in good faith, that we are required or permitted to disclose it under law. For example, if we receive a legal order that requires us to assist law enforcement, or if we are resolving a customer dispute.

IF we are sold, merged, dissolved, acquired or our ownership is significantly changed. You will be notified of these changes via email and/or a prominent notice on our site.

Anonymous Information does not disclose your identity or sensitive information. We may share this information with third parties to develop business strategies and build partnerships that enhance our site and services.

### SPECIAL NOTES
We use industry-leading, soundly tested technology and protocols to keep your Personally Identifiable Information safe, and we comply with HIPAA security requirements. Unfortunately, no system is 100% full proof. When sharing your information, please take precautions--use security software, keep your software up to date, and be web wise.

Our site is intended for a U.S. audience only and our Privacy Policy is designed to comply with U.S. law. From time to time, we may update this Privacy Policy. We will post the new date at the bottom of this Policy and the changes will become effective when posted.
By using our site, you are signaling that you accept our Privacy Policy. Please also see our Terms of Use
