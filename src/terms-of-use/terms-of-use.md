### Your Agreement
By using our website, you are agreeing to these Terms of Use. You will not use our website for any purpose that is unlawful or in violation of these Terms of Use. You also agree to our Privacy Policy, which covers how we handle your personal information.
From time to time, we may update these Terms of Use. When we do, we will post the date on this page. By continuing to use our site, you are agreeing to the updated Terms of Use.

### Content Ownership
We own our website, information concerning us, and our services. This includes, without limitation, text, images, software, graphics, button icons, audio and video clips, digital downloads, data compilations, logos and information that appear on our website or are part of our services. We also own all copyrights, trademarks, service marks, and trade names related to us.
We may present information on behalf of or licensed from a third party. This third-party information is proprietary to its owners.
We welcome your questions, comments and feedback. Please remember that if you submit content to us, then you are legally representing that you have the right to do so. If you do not have permission, do not share information that is confidential or proprietary. By sending us your comments, you are granting us ownership to those materials, even if they include ideas to improve our site. We can share those ideas without your consent, we do not have to pay you for them, and we may already be considering them. If you prefer to retain your rights, please do not submit your material.
If you believe the content on our site violates your copyright, please let us know by following the Copyright Procedure.

### How to Use Our Website
Our website is your partner and a powerful tool. We encourage you to use our site to learn, explore, search, compare, select and apply for health insurance products. Your use, however, must be for personal, non-commercial purposes. In other words, our site is intended for individuals to compare and shop for themselves and their families only.
You must also be at least 18 years old or legally emancipated with the ability to enter into contracts. And, since our website is intended for a U.S. audience, if you’re visiting our site from another country, keep in mind that you will have to comply not just with U.S. law, but the laws of that country.
The information that you provide to us must be accurate and up-to-date. Do not use our website to make false or fraudulent applications or purchases.
Do not use programs to frame our site or impede our site operations. This includes technology like "deep-links," "page-scrapes," "robots," and "spiders."
In addition, you are responsible for keeping your passwords, login and account information secret. Be Web Wise! And notify us immediately if you believe your account or information has been compromised.

### Third Party Links
Sometimes our site includes links to third parties. While we hope that these sites are informative, we do not control their content. Including these links on our site is not a sign that we endorse or approve them.

### Termination
Either of us can end this Agreement at any time. We may terminate your access to our site and services for any reason without prior notice. You can terminate by cancelling your account, unsubscribing to our emails, and stopping your use of our site. We will respect your request. If you have a pending health insurance application, however, we may be legally obligated to keep you updated on its status. Also, any provisions of these Terms of Use that would logically apply after termination, such as (but not limited to) Content Ownership and Disputes, will survive.

### Disputes
You are our VIP and we hope that we become your go to health insurance site. If a dispute does arise, however, then we each agree that the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of laws rules, will govern. If the dispute is not eligible for the JAMS Alternative Dispute Resolution process, then we each agree that the claims can only be litigated in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California and we each agree to these courts’ personal jurisdiction.

### Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of Liability
The law requires that we set out our disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability in all caps. This section may be long and look boring, but it’s important. Please read it.
