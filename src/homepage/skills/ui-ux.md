The “UI” in UI design stands for “user interface.” The user interface is the graphical layout of an application. It consists of the buttons users click on, the text they read, the images, sliders, text entry fields etc.
“UX” or User experience is determined by how easy or difficult it is to interact with the user interface elements.
