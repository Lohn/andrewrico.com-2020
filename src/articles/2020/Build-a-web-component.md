## # What are WebComponents? 

Web components are a group of web technologies that make it possible to create custom, reusable HTML elements whose functionality is encapsulated and thus completely separate from other code.

Concept and application
It is generally accepted among software developers to reuse code as far as possible. As is known, this was not so easy for custom markup structures. Just think of the complex HTML (as well as CSS and script) conglomerate that was sometimes necessary to create custom UI controls; and how the multiple use of such custom elements on a page can lead to a completely opaque confusion if you are not very careful.

Web components aim to solve these problems. Consisting of three main technologies that can be used together to create different and versatile custom elements with self-contained functionality that can be reused as often as you want without fear of different code interfering or interfering:

Web components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps. Custom components and widgets build on the Web Component standards, will work across modern browsers, and can be used with any JavaScript library or framework that works with HTML.

Web components are based on existing web standards. Features to support web components are currently being added to the HTML and DOM specs,letting web developers easily extend HTML with new elements with encapsulated styling and custom behavior.
