## The Challenges 

The challenge was not only to build a website but to create a brand from the grown up,
After making a brief review of the situation, i highlighted several important points i needed to focus on.

The next step was to choose a plataform to build the project, then i would come up with a great design for the website.

Creating the logo was an important part of the process, it would take me several weeks to ship the last version

The SEO part was as import as anything else. after all a beutiful website without been able to show in the search result of the prospects customers was that great at all.

## The Approach


The challenge was not only to build the website but to build a brand from the grownd up.

I used Wordpress as the Plataform to build the website
The design of the website was inspired by the [Mercedez-Bentz website](https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/)

The logo was slow an meticulus process, after several summitions, we decided to choose the most elegant yet exotic proposal.

For several months i worked hard on the SEO aspect of the brand, by looking at our competidors websites and doing a long reseach of keywords i rank one of the first five in the list by the thirth month the wbsite was lunched.
